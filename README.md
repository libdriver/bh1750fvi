### Install

Reference /interface IIC platform independent template and finish your platform IIC driver.

Add the /src directory, the interface driver for your platform, and your own drivers to your project, if you want to use the default example drivers, add the /example directory to your project.

### Usage

You can refer to the examples in the /example directory to complete your own driver. If you want to use the default programming examples, here's how to use them.

#### example basic

```C
#include "driver_bh1750fvi_basic.h"

uint8_t res;
uint32_t i, times;
bh1750fvi_address_t address;

/* set hardware params */
times = 3;
address = BH1750FVI_ADDRESS_LOW;

...
    
/* basic init */
res = bh1750fvi_basic_init(address);
if (res != 0)
{
    return 1;
}

/* delay 1000ms */
bh1750fvi_interface_delay_ms(1000);

...
    
for (i = 0; i < times; i++)
{
    float lux;

    /* basic read */
    res = bh1750fvi_basic_read(&lux);
    if (res != 0)
    {
        (void)bh1750fvi_basic_deinit();
        
        return 1;
    }

    /* output */
    bh1750fvi_interface_debug_print("%d/%d.\n", i + 1, times);
    bh1750fvi_interface_debug_print("%.2flux.\n", lux);

    /* delay 1000ms */
    bh1750fvi_interface_delay_ms(1000);
    
    ...
}

...
    
(void)bh1750fvi_basic_deinit();

return 0;
```

#### example shot

```C
#include "driver_bh1750fvi_shot.h"

uint8_t res;
uint32_t i, times;
bh1750fvi_address_t address;

/* set hardware params */
times = 3;
address = BH1750FVI_ADDRESS_LOW;

...
    
/* shot init */
res = bh1750fvi_shot_init(address);
if (res != 0)
{
    return 1;
}

...
    
for (i = 0; i < times; i++)
{
    float lux;

    /* shot read */
    res = bh1750fvi_shot_read(&lux);
    if (res != 0)
    {
        (void)bh1750fvi_shot_deinit();
        
        return 1;
    }

    /* output */
    bh1750fvi_interface_debug_print("%d/%d.\n", i + 1, times);
    bh1750fvi_interface_debug_print("%.2flux.\n", lux);

    /* delay 1000ms */
    bh1750fvi_interface_delay_ms(1000);
    
    ...
}

...
    
(void)bh1750fvi_shot_deinit();

return 0;
```
